you should start selling the idea to someone register his knowledge and how he got there to avoid to lost his trail and them create a knowledge map or tree to help people learn something based on how most people did, and them create some tests, or people develop for it etc

everything with visual stuff, something like node red or agar.io

and them, they will build his one knowledge tree

to use your tree to help solve some problem, them the system will try to match it to some oportunity, find people with same knowledge and create links

something like lates curriculum stuff

system to random change force graph attributes for better shown

each node means something (course, project etc)

things like about.me and navigation like google maps

http://mylearnpath.com/
